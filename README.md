# BruteForceVSRecursive_algorithms
C++ for Brute force and recursive algorithm

This code compares with the buruteforce algorithm and recursive algorithm and 
Initially it will genetares the random numbers and the above both algorithms will be
applied to the generated random numbers and provides the sorted time taken by both
the algorithms
